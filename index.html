    <h1>My name is Fernando</h1>
    <p>
       I am a Gamer, Programmer, Photoshoper, Video editor, and machine enthusiast. I have done alot of python and some c# along with batch and   shell commands. I like playing tons of video games from first person shooters to platformers and I own a pretty powerful gaming pc so I can play these games with high graphics, resolutions, and framerates. I also use this PC to play VR games with my VR headset and I also have a game console. The game console is nintendo switch which I figured out how to hack because the hardware I bought has a hardware vulnerability in the builted in recovery mode and as a result I can run custom software not approved by nintendo.
